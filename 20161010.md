What is the force which keeps an object following a circular path?
------------------------------------------------------------------

- A. Centrifugal
- B. Centripetal
- C. Acceleration
- D. Inverse
- E. Inertial

The correct answer is **B**.

In an Orbit...
--------------

... The Centripetal Force comes from Gravity.

Given that:

```
F_c = F_g
```

A balance between the centrifugal force (force that prevents a circular path, for a straight line) and the gravitational pull of an object (say, the Sun and the Earth, so that the Earth orbits in a roughly circular path).

Therefore, according to Kepler's Third Law, we could calculate the mass of an object with:

```
M = (4pi ^ 2 / G) * (d ^ 3 / P ^ 2)
1 = (a ^ 3 / P ^ 2)
```

Newton's Version of Kepler's Third Law
--------------------------------------

```
M_a + M_b = (a ^ 3) / (P ^ 2)
```

This equation applies to **any** two bodies orbiting each other around their common *center of mass*. Orbits can be *circular or eliptical*.

- `M_a` and `M_b` are masses of bodies in solar units.
- `a` is semi-major axis in astronomical units (AU).
- `P` is period of orbit in years.

Energy
------

Energy is the ability to generate motion - energy comes in many forms:

- Kinetic energy (motion).
- Thermal energy (heat).
- Chemical (food).
- ...

### Conservation of Energy

*"The energy in a closed system may change form, but the total amount of energy does not change as a result of any process."*

Note: the Earth is **not a closed system**, as the Earth may receive engery from the Sun and from radioactive waves in the space - while some energies are radiated into the space - while the total amount of energy did not change (in and outside of the Earth combined).

#### Kinetic Energy: Energy due to Motion

An object with mass `m` moving with velocity `V` has kinetic energy:

```
E_k = 1/2m * V^2
```

- Energy is measured in Joules.

#### Thermal Energy

Energy due to random microscopic motions, which we sense as heat. This property was not discovered until the 19th century.

#### Potential Energy

Energy available for conversion into other forms. Say, we have a ball on the table, which appears to stay still - may drop down the table with a gental nudge (potential energy converted to kinectic energy, provided by the gravitational pull).

Did energy disappear as the ball hits the ground? No:

- Some energy may be converted into force that breaks the floor.
- Some energy may be transformed into heat (the ball may heat up as it hits to the ground).

#### Gravitational Potential

An object with mass `m`, separated by distance `d` from another object of mass `M`, has the gravitational potential energy, in formula:

```
E_G = (-1) * G * [(m * M) / d]
```

Note that `E_G` is always **negative**.

- Objects closer together have a more negative `E_G`.
- Objects very far from each other (distant) have `E_G` close to zero.

A good example of this may be explained with an astroid impact:

- Friction to heat between the atmosphere and the astroid, leaving a trail of flame at its end as it enters the Earth's atmosphere.
- As the astroid hits the ground, the ground may break with a wave of shock.

Mass
----

### Conservation of Mass

Total mass before and after a chemical experiment appears to be the same. This can be understood by atomic theory:

- All matter is made of submicroscopic particles (atoms) with unchanging properties and masses.
- During an experiment, the atoms change their arrangements but are **not** themselves destroyed or altered.
- As a result, we find the *conservation of mass*.

#### Conservation of Mass (almost)

Atoms are in face made of smaller subatomic particles (protons, neutrons, and electrons). In special circustances (e.g., at the center of stars), these subatomic particles can be pulled apart and rearranged, allowing one type of atom to be **transformed** into another.

When this transformation occurs, the starting and ending masses of the atoms is not the same - the change in mass is converted to/from energy.

Remark: *A conversion between mass of energy, where mass could be understood as a very concentrated form of potential energy according to Einstein.*

#### Mass-Energy Equivalence

To understand conversion of mass into energy, we can think of mass as an extremely compace form of potential energy.

Einstein demonstrated that the energy `E` associated with mass `m` is

```
E = m * c ^ 2
```

Angular Momentum
----------------

Angular momentum measures the tendency of a spinning object to keep on spinning with its rotation axis pointing in the same direction, **unless** an external rotation force (torque) works to alter the rotation.

### Conservation of Angular Momentum

If no external forces (torque, specifically) to change the spin rate, then `m`, `V`, `R` remains constant.

An equation of angular momentum:

```
Angular Momentum = m * V * R = constant
```

According to the conservation definition, take an example of an ice skater:

- When the skater rotates with its arms stretched out, the rotation slows down relatively.
- When the skater holds in its arms, the rotation speeds up significantly (given a constant angular momentum, and the mass of the ice skater did not change, then V must change).

The Nature of Light
-------------------

Light is **radiant energy** which travels through emty space (unlike sound waves that must travel with media, air), from one point to another, **without** the need for a direct physical link.

Light travels at a velocity:

```
c = 299,792,458 m/s
```

Seven times around the Earth in one second.

Two models exist for light, each explaining some of the aspects of light:

- Light as a **Wave**.
- Light as a kind of **Particle**.

### Light as a Wave

In the wave model, light is regarded as coordinated disturbances in electric and magnetic energies.

- An electric disturbance creates a magnetic disturbance in the adjacent space (example: a car ignition).
- A magnetic disturbance creates an electric disturbance in the adjacent space (example: lawnmower ignition, a.k.a. the cord).

These disturbances feed of each other, creating an **electromagnetic wave** that travels through space.

#### Demonstrating the Wave Nature of Light

Sources of light **interfere** with each other, in the same way that water waves do.

- Constructive interference, high waves on "water".
- Destructive interference, no waves on "water".

When light passes through a narrow opening, it **diffracts** (spreads out) in the same wave that water waves do.

- Parallel waves of water, when moving through a gap, will spread out in radiant shapes.

### Light as a Particle

When we measure very weak light sources, we find the energy of the light comes in discrete packets.

- Red light from stoplight comes in packets of 3e-19 joules.
- We **always** measure whole-number multiples of this.
- **Incompatible** with mave model.

This phenomenon is known as the **quantization** of light, due to quantization, light can be described as being made of particles called **photons**.

### The Effect of Distance on Light

Individual photons maintain their speed and energy as they travel through space. However, objects look dimmer when they are farther away.

How could we explain this?

Photons coming from a distant object are spread out. Let's say there are 36 photos travelling from the Sun...

- At 1 AU, 36 photons/AU^2.
- At 2 AU, 9 photons/AU^2.
- At 3 AU, 4 photons/AU^2.

Given by the model...

#### The Inverse Square Model

The brightness we preceive at some distance `d` from a light source is a measurement of how much light falls on a square meter. We can calculate this by dividing the total light emitted by the surface area of the sphere with radius `d`.

```
Brightness = [Total Light Output] / (4 * Pi * d^2)
```

### Which is right?

Scientists argued for centuries about whether lgiht is a **wave** or a **particle**. In the early 20th century, it became clear that neither model fully explains light (with quantum mechanics). We now consider light to have **Wave-Particle Quantity**: some properties of light are wave-like, and others are particle-like.

- Lights reflected from a mirror - consider like particles.
- Light through a lens - consider like waves.

In practice, scientists decide which model to use based on the situation.
