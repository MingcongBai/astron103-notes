Which of these elements was first discovered in the Sun's spectrum?
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- A. Hydrogen
- B. Helium
- C. Lithium
- D. Carbon
- E. Oxygen

**Helium** was first discovered in the Sun's spectrum in mid-19th Century due to its distinctive yellow emission line (not discovered on Earth until the late 19th Century) - Helium was named after the word *Helios*, the word for the Sun.

Measuring Velocities
--------------------

Historically the Earth was believed to be fixed, unmoving center of the Universe. However...

- We know it moves relative to the Sun, the Sun moves relative to the center of our Galaxy, and so on...
- The velocity of any event is measured relative to an arbitrary *Rest Frame*:
  - A combination of the observer and their tools for measurements.

Galilean Relativity
-------------------

First to build a model of velocity calculation in between rest frames. To calculate the velocity of an object as measured in a different rest frame, we add the velocities of the objects **and** the rest frame.

Lorentz Contraction
-------------------

An attempt to account for the failure of the *Michaelson-Morley Experiment*.

*"As an object moves at speed V relative to the aether, its length shrinks by the Lorentz factor."*

Note: check formula.

Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity
---------------------------------------

Hypothesizes that the speed of light, `c`, has the same value in **every rest frame**.

Consequences:

- The length of moving objects becomes shorter (in the direction of motion) by the Lorentz Factor.
- The passage of time on moving objects becomes slower by the Lorentz Factor.

Note: *Lenght Contraction and Time Dilation* - **A physical phenomenom, not optical illusion**.

Relativistic Mass and the Light-Speed Barrier
---------------------------------------------

Hypothesis: The mass of a moving object becomes larger by the *Lorentz Factor*.

Consequences:

- To accelerate it closer to the speed of light requires an ever-greater force.
- Object with non-zero mass require an infinite force (or infinite object, as a conequence of `F = m * a`) to reach the speed of light.

Principles of Equivalence
-------------------------

Experiencing the gravitational pull of an object is indistinguishable from being in an accelerating frame of reference (rest frame).

As a consequence, lights may be deflected due to gravity (take the case of Solar Eclipse and the stars in the backdrop).
