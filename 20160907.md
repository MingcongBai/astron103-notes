**Astronomy 103: The Evolving Universe - Stars, Galaxies, and Cosmology**.
Prof. Rich Townsend.

The Alpha Centauri System
-------------------------

Triple star system, orbiting together by gravity.

#### Proxima Centauri

- Only 4.243 light years away: closest star to the Earth after the Sun.
- 0.12 times the mass of the Sun
- 500 times less luminous
- 4.85 years old
- Cooler on the surface, therefore showing dark red

A planet is recently observed to be closely orbiting around Proxima Centauri, orbit is 11.2 days in length; 1.3 times the mass of the Earth.

Probably rocky like the Earth, may harbor liquid water.

#### What can we learn from observing alone?

"On the subject of stars, all investigations which are not ultimately reducible to simple visual observations are ... necessarily denied to us. While we can conceive of the possibility of determining their shapes, their sizes, and their motions, we shall never be able by..." - [Auguste Comte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Comte)
