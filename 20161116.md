The Fate of Massive Stars
-------------------------

Recall, high mass stars are those stars with > 8 Solar Masses.

- Main-Sequence
- Blue Supergiant
- Yellow Supergiant
- Red Supergiant
- Supernova Explosion

### Nuclear Fusion Reations in a 25 S.M. Star

(Check Table 67.1 on Textbook for detailed element sequences)

- Progressively higher temperatures - because nuclei have to overcome stronger repulsive forces.
- Progressively shorter durations - because the amount of energy released is smaller and smaller.
- Much of the energy from later reactions is carried away by neutrinos.

Stellar Nucleosynthesis
-----------------------

At the beginning of the Universe, the only elements present were hydrogen and helium. All heavier elements have been made since then by nuclear fusion inside stars.

Reminder of how fusion releases energy:

- Combine nuclei to make new nucleus.
- New nucleus has a smaller mass than the starting nuclei.
- Difference in mass is released as energy (photons and neutrinos).

### Mass Excesses

- All elements ligher than iron contain more mass per proton/neutron.
- Combining these elements (via fusion) converts the mass excess into energy.
- The process stops at iron (56:Fe), no more enegy could be extracted.

Core Collapse
-------------

At the end of life of a high mass star, it contains an Earth-sized iron core (no more enegy could be extracted).

The core is supported by *electron degeneracy pressure*. Shortly after forming, densisites, and temperatures in the core become high enough for neutronization to occur:

Converting the core of the star into neutron, removing a large amount of electron.

- The loss of electrons causes a drastic drop in pressure, the core collapses in a fractio of a second.
- The core collapse is abruptly halted by neutron degeneracy pressure when it reaches 10km in diameter.

Supernova Explosion
-------------------

The pluging outer layers of the star hit the core and "bounce".

### Types of Supernova

- Type I: No Hydrogen.
  - Type Ia - Plenty of silicon, from a White Dwarf explosion.
  - Type Ib - Plenty of helium, from core collapse of a massive star that had lost its outer hydrogen layer in an earlier wind phase.
  - Type Ic - No helium, from core collapse of a massive star that had lost its outer hydrongen and helium layers in an earlier wind phase.
- Type II: Plenty of hydrogen.
  - From core collapse of a massive star.
