Which type of double star does gravity **not** cause the stars to orbit each other?

**Apparent double stars.**

Studying Stellar Evolution
--------------------------

During a star's lifetime, it can undergo significant changes in its radius, temperature, luminosity and even mass. But how can we study this "stellar evolution"?

- Stars have lifetimes from **millions** of years to **trillions** of years.
- Observing just one star over human timescales, we can't see any changes.

However, if we study a large sample of stars, we can expect to see stars at each stage of their evolution.

### The Hertzsprung-Russel (H-R) Diagram

Invented independently by Ejnar Hertzsprung (Danmark) and Henry Norris Russel (United States) - a scatter plot of stellar temperature vs luminosity.

Note: the temperature axis for this diagram is reversed (hottest on the left, coolest on the right).

### The H-R Diagram for Bright and Nearby Stars

- Spectral lines are shown above at the top (spectral classes are usually used).
- Temperature and luminosity axes are logarithmic.
- **90%** of the stars fall on a diagonal band known as the **main sequence**.

*But there are also stars in the upper right and lower left regions - what is going on?*

### The Stefan-Boltzmann Law

`L = (4 * pi * R) * (sig * (T ^ 4))`

Where:

- L:    the luminosity of star (energy emitted per second).
- R:    radius of star (finding surface area).
- sig:  Energy emitted per second.
- T:    surface temperature.

*As a consequence, lines of constant radii could be drawn on the H-R Diagram as slanted but parallel lines.*

### Non-Main Sequence Stars

From the H-R Diagram, there are two crowds of stars above and below the diagonal band:

- Stars below the diagonal band (with great temperature but very low luminosity) are identified as **White Dwarfs** - due to their small radii (according to Stefan-Boltzmann Law).
- Three groups are found above the diagonal band (from highest temperature to lowest):
  - **Blue Giants** have very high luminosity but lower temperature.
  - **Yellow Giants** have lower temperature but very high luminosity.
  - **Red Giants** have very low temperature but very high luminosity (due to large radius, according to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law).

### The Mass-Luminosity Relation for Main Sequence Stars

`L = M ^ 3.5`

Is known as the *Mass-Luminosity Relation* for **Main Sequence Stars**. Note that solar units should be used in the formula!

### Luminosity Classes

*Luminosity class* is determined from the boardening of the absorption lines.

- Narrow lines (Class I) = low density, large radius.
- Board lines (Class V) = high density, small radius.

Recall from the absorption line spectrum!

Note: stars on the main sequence are all referred as *"Class V Main Sequence"* class stars. And from above the diagonal line (top to bottom):

- *Ia*  - Bright Supergiants.
- *Ib*  - Supergiants.
- *II*  - Bright giants.
- *III* - Giants.
- *IV*  - Sub Giants.

*So what classification does White Dwarfs hold?*

None, as it does not fit in any of the standardized luminosity classification.

Stellar Evolution - The Sun
---------------------------

Recall the *Principles Governing the Structure of a Star*:

- Gravity holds the star together, pressure supports star against gravity. Gravity and pressure must balance (Hydrostatic Equilibrium).
- Pressure is created by high temperature in the star's core.
- High temperature causes heat to flow from core to surface, where it escapes into space as the star's luminosity (starlight).
- Escaping heat is replenished by nuclear fusion in core (hydrogen fuses into helium, initially).

Therefore, stars would eventually burn out of fuel. *What's next?*

**This depends on the mass of the star itself, high or low - either a Black Hole, or a White Dwarf - respectively**.

### Note

Stars always starts on the Main Sequence line (yellow or orange for low-mass; blue for high-mass), then, after the fuel is depleting:

#### Low Mass Stars

- Red Giant, ~30 times of Sun's radius.
- Yellow Giant, shrinks in size, but still quite a bit larger than the Sun.
- Second Red Giant, where when Helium burns out, the size grows again, much larger than the first Red Giant.
- A cloud of stellar matter (resulted from the old star).
- White Dwarf - or, the clouds around the old star would form new stars.

#### High Mass Stars

- Pulsating Yellow Giant, the radius of the star varies in phases of days.
- Red Supergiant, ~1000x Solar radius.
- Supernova due to explosion - of abrupt loss in support of the star's mass.
- Black Hole or Neutron Star.
