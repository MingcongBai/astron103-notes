At the Vernal Equinox...
------------------------

- A. ... fall begins in the Northern Hemisphere.
- B. ... the Sun crosses the celestial equator.
- C. ... days are much longer than nights.
- D. ... nights are much longer than days.
- E. ... the Sun is directly overhead in Greenwich, England.

The correct answer is B, at Vernal Equinox (or Equinoxes), the ecliptic crosses the celestial equator (sun rises at virtually exactly at the East, and sets virtually at the West).

Phases of the Moon
------------------

Terminologies to know:

- Waxing, getting bigger;
- Waning, getting smaller;

The cycle of the moon phases is approximately 17.5 days in length:

#### Waxing

- Crescent;
- 1st Quarter;
- Gibbous;
- Full;

#### Waning

- Gibbous;
- 3rd Quarter;
- Crescent;
- New;

Why does the moon have phases?
------------------------------

The **same side** of the Moon always faces toward the Earth, depending on the positions of Earth, Moon and Sun, this side is either fully illuminated, partly illuminated, or dark.

Lunar Month vs Sidereal Month
-----------------------------

Comparing the length of the two:

- Lunar Month: 29.5 days.
- Sidereal Month: 27.3 days.

Recall sidereal day, and a Solar Day.

The Moon throughout the year
----------------------------

In the winter, as opposed to the summer, the Moon rises and goes at a higher path. We are usually able to see the Moon earlier in a day in the Winter.

Solar and Lunar Eclipses
------------------------

- In a Solar Eclipse, the Moon's shadow casts at the Earth.
- In a Lunar Eclipse, the Earth's shadow casts at the Moon.

What Moon Phase is required for a Solar Eclipse?
------------------------------------------------

- A. Full
- B. Gibbous
- C. Quarter
- D. Crescent
- E. New

The answer is E, in the case of a Solar Eclipse, the Moon must be in between of the line between the Earth and the Sun - in this situation, there is no Solar reflection on the Moon, therefore a New Moon, with no illumination.

Stages of Eclipse
-----------------

- Panumbra: around the "core" of the shadow of the Moon on the Earth, we see a "bite" out of the Sun in the sky, and eventually the Sun become a "crescent".
- Umbra: a total Eclipse, only "winds" out of the Sun is visible. The position on Earth is in almost complete darkness.

Why is the Mon red during a Lunar Eclipse?
------------------------------------------

While the Earth's shadow completely covers the Moon, some of the sunlight is "bent" or deflected in the Earth's atmosphere onto the Moon.

Therefore in this case, Moon shows up as red.
