Formation of a Planetary Nebula
-------------------------------

- As the outer layer are removed, the deeper layers cool and expand - *fusion stops*.
- High enery photons from the *hot core* begin to escape, driving a *fast wind*.
- The fast wind sweeps up...

Planetary Nebulae
-----------------

Rings of ejected gas, lit up by high energy photons from a hot core - showing a great variety in shape and color.

After around 15,000 years, the gas is so diffuse and distant from the core, it is no longer lit up, the Planetary Nebula phase is therefore ended.

The White Dwarf Phase
---------------------

As the hot core of a dead star cools down, it becomes a *white dwarf*.

- Composed mainly of oxygen and cabon (with thin surface layer of hydrogen and helium).
- Mass up to 1.4 Solar Masses (from an original star up to 8 Solar Masses).
- Radius similar to the Earth's.
- Density of a million times that of water - 1 ton per cubic centimetre.

No nuclear burning in white dwarfs, they simply cool down as they loose their heat into space.

- Million of years to go from 100,000K to 20,000K.
- Billions of years to go from 20,000K to 5,000K.

Ignition of Accreted Hydrogen
-----------------------------

Hydrogen builds up until it is hot and dense enough to begin fusing.

- The ignition heats up surrounding hydrogen, resulting in a *thermonuclear runaway*.
- The luminosity increases by 100,000 times or more, resulting in "New Star" or "nova" (*nova stella*) in the sky.

Mass Loss During a Nova
-----------------------

- After a nova, the accretion process begins again.
- Sometimes, we see the same system go nova repeatedly (a *recurrent nova*).
- Depending on the nova details, the white dwarf mass increases or decreases over time.

The Chandrasekhar Limit
-----------------------

White dwarfs pack a Solar Mass or more into the size of Earth.

- They are supported against the immense pull of gravity by the pressure form *electron degeneracy*.
- As mass is added to a white dwarf, their radius shrinks (a peculiar property of degeneracy).
- Above a certain point (the *Chandresekhar Limit*) the shrinkage becomes a runaway process - The white dwarf **collapses**.
- For "Standard" white dwarfs, the limit is ~1.4 Solar Masses.

### Collapse and Explosion

- Accretion onto a white dwarf raises it above the Chandrasekhar Limit.
  - The white dwarfs begins to collapse.
  - The collapse compresses and heats the carbon and oxygen to the point where fusion reactions begin.
- This is a runaway process which blows the white dwarf apart in a *supernova*.

### Type Ia and II Supernovae

Research.

### Supernova Remnants

- Hot bubbles of gas left over from the supernova explosion.
- Rich in carbon and oxygen, and silicon, iron, and other heavy elements.
- *Cosmic Rays* are produced by the interaction between heavy nuclei and magnetic fields.
