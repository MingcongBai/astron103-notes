Molecular Clouds: The Site of New Star Formation
------------------------------------------------

Formed of gas and interstellar dust, with typical masses of ~10,000 solar masses - in some cases, *giant molecular clouds* may hold a mass of ~1,000,000 solar masses. Temperature is very low, ~10K.

Internal probing is difficult due to obscuration.

### Interstellar Dust

- Tiny solid grains of rock-like materials (silicon or carbon).
- Covered in thin ice layer made from water, methane or ammonia.

### Bok Globules

Very dense, no visible light could escape or pass through:

- Around 1 LY across.
- Mass of 2-50 solar masses.

Each globule will eventually form **one or more** stars. Time scale for star formation ranges from 100,000 yeasrs to 100,000,000 years (dependent on sizes according to the textbook).

Stages of Star Formation
------------------------

- Interstellar cloud: as described above.
- Protostar: the densest area within Bok Globules, will eventually form a star.
- Pre-Main Sequence Star: disk of dust and a dense center, with bi-polar outflow.

### The Protostar Phase

Gravity pulls material in toward the central part of a dense clump (Bok Globule), forming the protostar as a result:

- The in-falling material forms a hot *accretion disk*.
  - Accreting material heats up as it falls in (conservation of energy).
  - Accreting material rotates faster as it approaches the protostar (conservation of *angular momentum*).
- The protostar remains hidden from sight by the surrounding cloud.
- This phase lasts 10-100 thousand years - relatively short.

#### Bi-polar Outflows

Often times, accreting protostars will launch *bi-polar outflows* along the rotation axis, at velocities of some hundreds of kilometres per second:

- Outflows extents at several Light Years.

Reason to this phenomenom remains unclear - but gravity is suspected to be the cause.

### The Pre-Main Sequence Star

Most of the material surrounding the star has been used up - **the star is now visible**. Then, then star contracts, resulting in increased temperature in the core.

- Still too cool in core for hydrogen burning.
  - Deuterium burning occurs at this point.
- Some PMS stars show erratic brightness variations - *T-Tauri* stars.
- Timescales from 2-200 million years - faster for more massive stars.

A Star-Forming Region in the H-R Diagram
----------------------------------------

Massive stars form more quickly than low-mass stars:

- Therefore, a star-forming region often contains main sequence massive stars, and low-mass stars.
- The radiation from the massive stars can influence the formation of the low-mass stars.

(Check the textbook or lecture slides for evolutionary tracks. Note: dotted line represents protostars, and solid lines represents PMS stars)

### Limits on the Masses of Stars

When we survey the stars, we find most stars have masses between about 0.2 to 20 solar masses.

- Stars below 0.2 solar masses are dim and difficult to discover.
- Stars above 20 solar masses are quite rare.

In fact, there are fundamental physical reason why we do not find very low mass or very high mass stars:

- Below 0.08 solar masses, the core never becomes hot enough for hydrogen fusion, forming a *brown dwarf*.
- Aoove 150 solar masses, the intense radiation from the star prevents it from forming, and/or caues it to lose mass very quickly.

Hydrostatic Equilibrium in Low and High Mass Stars
--------------------------------------------------

Hydrostatic equilibrium is the balance between (inward) gravity and (outward) force of pressure at every point of a star (recall).

Comparing low (0.1 solar masses) and high mass (10 solar masses) stars:

- Core density and pressure is lower in high mass stars.
- Core temperature is higher in high mass stars.

Internal Structures of Main Sequence Stars
------------------------------------------

- Below 0.4 solar masses: Fully convective.
- Between 0.4 and 1.3 solar masses: Convective envelope, radiative core.
- Above 1.3 solar masses: Radiative envelope, convective core.

Main-Sequence Lifetime of Sun
-----------------------------

90% of the Sun's overall lifetime will be spent on the main sequence (hydrogen to helium conversion).

*Rule of thumb: 8% of a star's mass is available as hydrogen "fuel" during the main sequence.*

- For the Sun, fuel is burned at a rate of 360 * 10^9 kilograms per second.
- Main sequence lifetime of the Sun could now be calculated to 1.2 * 10^10 years.
