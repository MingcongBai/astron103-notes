Walter Baade Discovers "Stellar Populations"
--------------------------------------------

Baade worked at the 100-inch Hooker telescope in Mount Wilson, CA (outside of Los Angeles). Studying nearby galaxies, he noticed a trend in the distribution of stars:

- Blue stars concentrated in the disk (Population I)
- Red stars concentrated in the bulge and halo (Population II)

### Populations in the Milky Way

#### Motions:

- Population I stars have circular orbits aligned with disk.
- Population II stars have eliptical orbits inclined to disk.

#### Age

- Population I stars are young (a few billion years).
- Population II stars are old (over 10 billion years).

### Composition

- Population I stars are rich in "metals" (~2% in mass).
- Population II stars are poor in "metals" (~0.02% in mass).

### Populations in Clusters

- Population I stars are usually found in open clusters (disk at the Milky Way).
- Population II stars are usually found in globular cluters (found at the bulge and halo).

What are Population III stars?
------------------------------

The very first generation of stars (hypothetical).

They are composed solely of hydrogen and helium only - no "metals". Massive Population III stars would have died billions of years ago; but some lower mass Population III stars may still had survived.

### What are they?

- Maybe they are masquerading as Population II stars (polluted surface layers).
- Maybe they are not there; only massive stars formed in the first generation.

*James Webb Space Telescope* should be able to see them in the ancient Universe.

Galatic Cannibalism
-------------------

After its initial formation, a galaxy can continue to grow by *cannibalism* - mergers with other galaxies. These merger add new stars, dust, and gas.

During a merger, stars don't collide (because they occupy such a tiny fraction of space), but they are drawn out into *tidal stream*.

Gas clouds do collide, and this triggers new waves of star formation.

Interstellar Medium (ISM)
-------------------------

The stuff (gas and dust) between the stars.

On average, the density is very low:

- 1 atom per cubic centimetre.
- Compare our atmosphere: 10e+19 atoms per cubic centimetre.

A reservoir of material for forming new generation of stars - as gravity pulls the ISM into Galatic Disks.

### ISM Structures: Emission Nebulae

- Hot O and B stars produce *ultraviolet photons* which *ionize* hydrogen in nearby stars.
- When their elecron eventually re-combines (re-attaches to the nucleus), it is an excited state.
- As it transitions to the groudn state, the electron emits photons from the *Balmer Series*.

### ISM Structures: Reflection Nebulae

*Scattering* of starlight by a cloud containing *dust grains* produces a *reflection nebula*.

Example: The Pleiades, an open cluster with a surrounding reflection nebula.

### ISM Structures: Dark Nebulae

Cold, dense clouds, some sunlights get through (if density is sparse enough), but...

- It is dimmer ("extinction").
- It contains less blue light than before ("reddenning").

Tracing Atomic Hydrogen in the Milky Way
----------------------------------------

Hot Hydrogen Gas:

- Ionized - H II.
- Easily seen in emission nebulae.

Cold Hydrogen Gas:

- Not ionized - H I.
- Difficult to see at visible wavelengths.
- Produces 21 centimitre radio emission by flipping the electron spin.
- Doppler shift of 21 centimetre emission gives the velocity.
