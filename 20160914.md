i>clicker question
------------------

Which planet is closest in size to Earth?

- A. Mercury
- B. Venus
- C. Mars
- D. Jupiter
- E. Saturn

The answer is B - Venus, **not** C - Mars, as Mars is only roughly half the radius of the Earth.

The scientific method
---------------------

An approach to acquire new knowledge, took centuries to reach.

Observing interesting objects in the world, priliminary study, testing, proving, ..., production of new idea/theory/knowledge.

**From prediction to knowledge.**

The scientific method has interaction between the society, scientific community, via communication with peers.

#### Terminologies

- **Hypothesis:** An idea that can be tested against the observable Universe ("All swans are white").
- **Theory:** A hypothesis that has been extensively tested and not yet disproven (Einstein's Theory of Relativity).
- **Law:** A mathematical statement which encapsulates a theory (Newton's Second Law: *F = ma*).
- **Model:** A schematic representation of a physical system (The Earth is a sphere).

#### Scientific methods in Astronomy

*"The most incomprehensible thing about the Universe is that it is comprehensible."*

— Albert Einstein, *Physics and Reality*

The hypothesis of Universality: the laws and theories we discover here on Earth also apply to the Universe (and vice-versa).

The Classical Atomic Model
--------------------------

Atoms were believed to be a mini Solar System in the classical atomic model.

- Negatively-charged **electrons** orbit around a positively-charged **nucleus**.
- The nucleus is composed of positively-chared **protons** and uncharged (electronically neutral) **neutrons**.
- Usually, the number of protons **equals** the number of electrons; an atom is uncharged.

Compare to the [modern atomic model](http://www.mikeblaber.org/oldwine/chm1045/notes/Atoms/AtomStr2/atom.gif).

The Periodic Table
------------------

The classical arrangement of matters found in the Universe (so far).

- Atomic number: number of protons in nucleus.
- Atomic mass: mass of nucleus in atomic mass units (1.66 x 10^-27 kg); about the same as the number of protons and neutrons.

Elementary Particles in the Standard Model
------------------------------------------

The [Standard Model](https://people.rit.edu/~jng4080/Images/Information/Periodic%20Tables/The%20Periodic%20Table%20of%20Elementary%20Particles%20and%20Forces.jpg).

- A proton is composed of two up quarks and one down quark.
- A neutron is composed of two down quarks and one up quark.

The Four Forces
---------------

#### The Gravitational Force

Attraction between all masses. Gravity is **always attractive.**

- **Associated Property:** Mass
- **Relative strength:** 10^-36
- **Carrier particle:** Graviton

#### The Electromagnetic Force

Attraction between opposite charges, repulsion between like charges.

The electromagnetic force is tied up with lights - photons are particles of light.

- **Associated Property:** Electric charge
- **Relative strength:** 1
- **Carrier particle:** Photon

#### The Strong (Nuclear) Force

Powerful attraction between quarks; Holds atomic nuclei together.

- **Associated Property:** Color charge
- **Relative strength:** 10^2
- **Carrier particle:** Gluon

#### The Weak (Nuclear) Force

Interaction that can cause particles to change. Related to radioactive decay.

- **Associated Property:** Week charge
- **Relative strength:** 10^-7
- **Carrier particle:** W and Z particles

The Celestial Sphere
--------------------

View "sphere" of our night sky, stars are so big in the sky, the view really doesn't change much with movement or change of eyesights (closing one eye).

Stars appears as if they are painted on the "wall" of the sphere, but truly they are much further away, just the fact that they are "mapped" on the "wall".

The star at the top pole of the sphere is the **Zenith**, and the opposite pole is the **Nadir**.

Asterisms and Constellations
----------------------------

#### Asterisms

As defined (taken during Stellarium demonstration):

*"In astronomy, an asterism is a pattern of stars recognized in the Earth's night sky. It may be part of an official constellation or it may be composed of stars from more than one constellation."*

— Wikipedia, *"Asterism (astronomy)"*

#### Constellations

As defined (taken during Stellarium demonstration):

*"A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names.*

*In 1922 the International Astronomical Union officially recognized the 88 modern constellations, covering the entire sky. They began as the 48 classical Greek constellations laid down by Ptolemy in the Almagest. Constellations in the far southern sky are late 16th- and mid 18th-century constructions. 12 of the 88 constellations compose the zodiac signs.*

*The term constellation can also refer to the stars within the boundaries of that constellation. Notable groupings of stars that do not form a constellation are called asterisms. When astronomers say something is “in” a given constellation they mean it is within those official boundaries."*

— Wikipedia, *"Constellation"*

Stars during daytime
--------------------

Stars were not seen during daytime, as the Sun glows on the atmosphere, making it glow blue, blocking the view to the stars.

All stars rise in the east and sets in the west (like the Sun), if they ever set below the horizon.

#### Circumpolar Stars

*"A circumpolar star is a star that, as viewed from a given latitude on Earth, never sets (that is, never disappears below the horizon), due to its proximity to one of the celestial poles. Circumpolar stars are therefore visible from said location toward nearest pole for the entire night on every night of the year (and would be continuously visible throughout the day too, were they not overwhelmed by the Sun's glare)."*

— Wikipedia, *"Circumpolar star"*

i>clicker question
------------------

Standing at the Earth's North Pole, how do the stars move?

- A. They don't - they're stationary.
- B. Rising in the East and setting in the West.
- C. Rising in the West and setting inthe East.
- D. Neither rising or setting, but moving right and parallel to the horizon.
- E. Neither rising or setting, but moving left and parallel to the horizon.

The answer is D. More to be explained about the Celestial Equator.
