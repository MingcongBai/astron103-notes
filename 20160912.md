Covering Units 1 and 2 today.

Space is big...
---------------

*"Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the chemist, but that's just peanuts to space."*

— Douglas Adams, *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*

The Earth
---------

A spinning sphere of rock and metal, with a thin surface layer of liquid and gas.

- Home to humanity.
- Radius: 6,371 kilometres.
- Mass of 5.972 x 10^24 kg.
- Surface features shaped by geological processes: wind, water, volcanism, crust movements.

The Moon
--------

The Earth's only natural satellite (a body which orbits around a plaent).

- The farthest limit of direct human exploration.
- Distance from earth of 400,000 kilometres.
- Radius is 0.27 of Radius of the Earth (R⊕).
- Mass of 0.012 of Mass of the Earth (M⊕).
- Heavily cratered surface (lack of atmosphere for weak gravity, many impacts from astronomical objects, no geological activity for a lack of internal heat).

The Four Inner Planets
----------------------

Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars (in order of distance from the Sun). Similar to the Earth in surface features.

#### Mercury

Rocky planet with hot surface temperature during daytime, no atmosphere.

#### Venus

Rocky planet with atmosphere, strong green house effect (high surface temperature as heat cannot escape), sulphuric-acid rain storms.

#### Mars

Half the radius of the earth, cold and thin atmosphere. No liquid water, carbon-dioxide snow.

The Four Outer Planets
----------------------

Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (in order of distance from the Sun). With methane, carbon dioxide, or ammonia atmosphere.

#### Jupiter

Gas giant, storm went on for centuries (for as long as we have observed it).

#### Saturn

Gas giant, slightly smaller in size (still 11 times of Earth Radius). Brilliant ring.

#### Uranus and Neptune

Ice giants, may have icy cores under a thick atmosphere.

Sizes in scale
--------------

 Planet    | Radius in Scale
-----------|------------------
 Mercury   |  0.38 R⊕
 Venus     |  0.95 R⊕
 Earth     |  1.00 R⊕
 Mars      |  0.53 R⊕
 Jupiter   |  11.00 R⊕
 Saturn    |  9.14 R⊕
 Uranus    |  3.98 R⊕
 Neptune   |  3.86 R⊕

The Sun
-------

The nearest star to the Earth (a huge ball of gas which generates energy by nuclear reactions in its center).

- The source of energy that makes life Earth possible.
- Distance to Earth: 150,000,000 kilometres.
- Radius: 109 R⊕.
- Mass of 333,000,000 M⊕.
- Surface temperature of 5,770K (Kelvin, `[K] = [°C] + 273.15`).

All planets in the Solar System may fit in the Sun (1% in all materials in relation to the Sun).

All planets orbits in rougly the same plane.

Dwarf Planets
-------------

Smaller planets (too small for a planet classification) may orbit around the Astroid Belts (Kuiper Belt in which Pluto, and Eris orbits; the Belt behind Mars where Ceres orbits).

Comets
------

Halley's Comet, like most comets, which orbits in a eliptical path which forms a long white tail when getting closer to the Sun (or their local stars, respectively).

Comets were recorded in historical observations but with interpretations with significant historical, political, and religious meanings (for example, the Doomsday).

The Astronomical Unit
---------------------

A yardstick for the Solar System, which is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun (Earth orbit is **not perfectly circular**).

**1 AU = 149,597,870.7 km**

Useful for measuring other orbits in the Solar System:

- Mars orbits at approximately 1.5 AU from the Sun.
- Jupiter orbits at approximately 5.2 AU from the Sun.

The Nearest Star System: Alpha Centauri
---------------------------------------

The Alpha Centauri system (A, B, and Proxima) is the closest to the Solar System.

- 40,000,000,000,000 (40 trillion) kilometres or 270,000 AU.
- 74,000 years traveling athe the speed of Voyager I.
- 4.245 years for traveling at the speed of light (the fastest possible).

A Light Year
------------

A yardstick for the Universe beyond - the distance traveled by light (in a vacuum) in a year.

- Corresponds 9.46 x 10^12 kilometres (little under 10 trillion kilometres).
- Useful for measuring distances outside the Solar System.
  - Nearest star (Proxima Centauri): 4.246 LY.
  - Brightest star (Sirius): 8.611 LY.
  - Most distant naked-eye star (V726 Cas): 16,310 LY.

Also tells us the look-back time how long ago light left the object, to arrive at our eyes/telescope now (in respect to their distance, for example, we are seeing Proxima Centauri's light from 4.246 years ago).

The Milky Way
-------------

Our Sun is one star in the **100 billion** stars making up the Milky Way galaxy.

The Milky Way is shaped like a disk, with spiral arms stretching out from a central bulge. The stars in the Milky Way, together with clouds of dust and gas, orbit the center.

The Milky Way is about 100,000 LY across.

*The Super Massive Blackhole?*

#### In a scale

The Milky Way, along with M31, M33, and other galaxies and dwarf galaxies form the Local Group is a part of Virgo Supercluster with Virgo Cluster, Fornax Cluster, and more...

... And that forms a little part of the Visible Universe.

The Visible Universe
--------------------

The most distant objects we can see in the Visible Universe are 13.8 billion LY away. This tells us that the Universe cannot be more than 13.8 billion years old - otherwise, we would see the light from the oler parts.
