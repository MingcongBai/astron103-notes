During its waxing gibbous phase, what fraction of the Moon's total area is illuminated by the Sun?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A. 0
- B. 1/4
- C. 1/2
- D. 3/4
- E. 1

Note that the correct answer is **C**, the surface area illuminated on the Moon by the Sun is always 1/2, regardless of the Moon's phase. Moon, like the Earth, has day/night cycle, which results in this phenomenom.

Wave-particle Duality
---------------------

Some properties of light are wave-like, while some other are particle-like.

The "Classical" Atom
--------------------

- Protons and Neutron in nucleus of an Atom.
- Electrons orbit around nucleus (like a micro-Solar System), due to the electric force attracting them to the nucleus.

...

Found to be incorrect later.

The Quantumn Atom
-----------------

Wave-particle duality applies not only to light but also matter - the wave-like nature of electrons means that they are "smeared" out into clouds of "elecron-nes".

- It also means that electrons can only move in orbits whose circumference is a whole number of waves (between crests).
- The three-dimensional distribution of the electron wave in one of theses special orbits is known as an *"orbitals"*.
- The smallest orbital is known as the *"ground state"*.

Another evidence for electron wave-like behavior (recall: Oct 10 on wave-like light behavior) is the interference pattern for two sources of electrons.

### Asorption of Radiation

Moving an electron from a lower orbital (closer to nucleus) to a higher orbital requires energy.

- This energy can be provided when the atom *absors* a photon.
- The energy of the photon must be exactly **match** the energy difference between the initial and final orbitals.

(Note: this will be later seen with the differnce in energy of differently colored lights)

### Emission of Radiation

Similar to the case with absorption. An atom is an *excited state* when one or more electrons is in a higher orbital than the *ground state*.

- The excited electron can be spontaneously drop back to a lower orbital, causing the atom to *emit* a photon.
- The energy of emitted photon must **match** the energy difference between the initial and final orbitals.

### Identifying Elements from their Emission

The energy of emitted light depends on the energies of the orbitals involved in the emission. These energies in turn depend on the type (*element*) of the atom.

We can determine the element by looking at the energy (color) of the emission.

(Note: the heating of element experiment found on the textbook)

Wavelength and Color
--------------------

We perceive the wavelength of light as its color:

- Deep red light has a wavelength of 7e-7 metres.
- Violet light has a wavelength of 4e-7 metres.

### Wavelength

The physical distance between successive wave crests (measured in meters, nanometers, etc.).

### Frequency and Wavelength

The *frequency* of a wave is the number of wave crests passing a given point each second (measured in hertz, Hz; or crests-per-second).

Higher frequency:

- More waves pass a given point each second.
- Shorter physial distance between successive wave crests.

Lower frequency:

- Less waves pass a given point each second.
- Longer physial distance between successive wave crests.

Described with this equation below:

```
Wavelength * Frequency = Speed
```

<div class="page-break"></div>

The Energy of Photons
---------------------

Given by the equations below:

- From the wavelength...

```
E = (h * c) / (lambda)
```

- From the frequency...

```
E = h * v
```

Where `h` is the Planck's constant, given by:

```
h = 6.63e-34 J*s
```

Therefore...

- Red lights has **longer** wavelength, **smaller** frequency, and **less** energetic photons.
- Blue lights has **shorter** wavelength, **larger** frequency, and **more** energetic photons.

The Invisible Lights
--------------------

There are more colors to lights that we can see.

- **Ultraviolet**: shorter wavelenghts than the most "violet" color visible to human.
- **Infrared**: longer waveslengths tan the most "red" color visible to human.

By experiments conducted the Ritter, *ultraviolet radiation* resulted in the darkening of photograph paper - showing the evidence to electromagnetic radiation.

The Electromagnetic Spectrum
----------------------------

From shortest wavelengths to the longest (wavelengths are approximated from the spectrum graph presented in class)...

Type              | Wavelengths
------------------|-------------------
Gamma-Rays        | (0.001 nm)
X-Rays            | (0.1 nm)
Ultraviolet       | (10 nm - 400 nm)
Visible Light     | (400 nm - 700 nm)
Infrared          | (10 um - 1 mm)
Microwaves        | (10 mm - 1 m)
Radio Waves       | (1 m - 100 m)

(Note: review the *Electromagnetic Spectrum* graph on the textbook)

### The Andromeda Galaxy Across the EM Spectrum

- Our eyes can't see electromagnetic radiation outside the narrow visible part of the *Spectrum*.
- However, we can build instruments that can measure this radation and create images.

The Blackbody
-------------

A *theoretical object* which absorbs all radiation falling on it. Different from isolated atoms, which can only absorb radiation at specific wavelengths or frequencies.

When blackbodies are heated, they **emit radiation at all wavelengths, with very specific properties**.

### Stovetop

As the stove heats up, it begins to emit light, the color of the light depends on the temperature of the stove:

- Cool: black (invisible light), infrared.
- Warm: red.
- Hot: yellow.

<div class="page-break"></div>

Wien's Law
----------

*"The hotter a body is the more strongly it will radiate at short wavelengths."*

Note that the amount of emission at **ALL** wavelengths also increases!

The law can be expressed as:

```
T = (2.9 * 10e6 Knm) / (Lambda_max)
```

**Wien's Law only applies to thermal radiation!**

(Note: more on the textbook at a graph comparing lamps in regard with the Wien's Law)

Measuring Temperature with Kelvin
---------------------------------

The *Kelvin* (K) temperature scale directly measures the amount of the *thermal energy* (heat) of an object.

- At 0 K (*absolute zero*), the object has no thermal energy.
- if the temperature (in Kelvin) doubles, then the object's thermal energy doubles.

Note, you should always use Kelvin in scientific calculation involving heat/thermal energy.
