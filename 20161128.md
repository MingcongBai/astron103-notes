Galatic Rotation
----------------

Let there be 4 points A, B, C, and D on different radius within a circular area, moving at a circular path according to the center of the circle.

- A wheel rotates as most would imagine: A-D takes the same time around the orbit, **solid-body rotation**.
- Planets orbiting a star: A-D takes different time to complete one orbit, **differential rotation**. In particular, D at the largest radius orbits the slowest, while A, closest to the center, orbits the fastest.

A Galaxy is similar, but A-D rotates at approximately the same rate of speed, but it takes different times to complete one orbit due to different length in path.

We could measure galatic mass with from galatic *rotation*.

```
M(_<R) = (V^2 * R) / G
```

Where:

- `M` is the mass notation.
  - `_<R` specifies the mass to be "mass within a certain radius"
- `V` is the velocity for a certain astronomical object (say, the Sun; however usually calculated to be 220 km/s).
- `R` is the distance (radius) from the center of the galaxy.
- `G` is the standard G.

Dark Matter
-----------

The rotation curve of the Milky Way suggests there is additional mass that we can't detect, we call this additional mass "Dark Matter" (we could only indirectly *infer* that it exists with gravity).

Other pieces of evidence of dark matter in the Milky Way:

- Motion of the Solar System above and below the disk plane (galatic plain).
- Orbits of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way suggesting a huge amount of excess mass in Milky Way.

Dark matter accounts for **~90%** of the mass of the Milky Way!

Note: evidence for dark matter is found in other structures throughout the Universe (galaxies and galaxy clusters).

THe Distribution of Stars
-------------------------

The Milky Way contains ~100 Billion stars, however, the stars are not distributed uniformly. The *Stellar Density* measures how many stars (on average) in each parsec-sized cube (`pc^3`):

- At the Sun's location (8 kpc), density of 0.1 star/pc^3.
- At the outer edge (16 kpc), density is 0.01 star/pc^3.

...

- At the center of the galaxy (< a few parsecs), density is 10,000 stars/pc^3!

Sagittarius A*
--------------

Commonly known to be the center of the Milky Way galaxy, only visible to invisible wavelengths:

- A very bright center of the galaxy.
- Produces a strong gamma ray bubble of ~20,000 LYs across.
- Looking closer, stars seems to be moving in orbits at the very center as if there is an object of immense mass.

Using the mass equation discussed above, the Sagittarius A\* may have a mass of 4e+6 Solar Masses. This suggests that this must be a black hole (packing such amount of mass into such a small volume).

The black hole in Sagittarius A\* is unlike the stallar mass black holes formed during core collapse, it is a *super-massive black hole*, or simply *SMBH*.

The Winding Problem and Pattern Speed
-------------------------------------

Research.

Note: Pattern Speed is different from Star Speed.

### Star Formation during Wave Passage

- Passage of a density wave compresses clouds and triggers star formation.
- The OB stars formed in this way will die before they leave the arm.
  - This explains why OB stars are only found in spiral arms.

Outside of the Milky Way
------------------------

*We can see more galaxies beyond the Milky Way, than there are stars in the Milky Way.*

More than 100 billion galaxies could be observed with present instruments, where the Milky Way only contains ~100 billion stars.

### Early Studies of Galaxies

Galaxies have low *surface brightness* (brightness per unit area on the celestial sphere), and telescopes are required for the studying of galaxies.

Charles Messier cataloged faint, diffuse patches of light (the "M" system); some of these turn out to be galaxies - M31, the Andromeda Galaxy. The Herschels, and later John Dreyer, created a more comprehensive catalog of New General Catalog (NGC-prefixed objects).

### Measuring Distances to Galaxies

Foreign galaxies are usually too far for parallax to be useful. However, *Cephid* variables can be used as *Standard Candles*:

- Measure the period of a *Cephid* variable in a distant galaxy.
- Calculate the lumonosity using the *period-luminosity relationship*.
- Calculate the distance from the luminosity and brightness:

`d = sqrt( L / (4 * Pi * B) )`

Where:

- `d` is the distance.
- `L` is the luminosity.
- `B` is the average brightness.

### Galaxy Redshifts

Spectral lines in galaxies seems to be red-shifted - transversed to longer wavelengths with distance.

(Research: recessive velocity)

### Hubble's Law

*The faster a galaxy recedes, the farther away it is.*

`V = H * d`

Where:

- `V` is the recessive velocity, in km/s.
- `H` is the Hubble Constant (70 km/s per Mega-Parsec).
- `d` is the distance to a given galaxy, in Mega-Parsecs.

Note:

- Hubble's Law does not work for nearby glaaxies (e.g. M31, which is **approaching us**, with negative recessive velocity).
- Doesn't work well for galaxies in clusters.
