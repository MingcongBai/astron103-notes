Hydrostatic Equilibrium
-----------------------

The outward pressure force must balance the inward gravitational force at every distance from the center of the Sun.

The Ideal Gas Law
-----------------

The *pressure* (force exerted on a unit area) of a gas increases in proportion to the *temperature and *density* of the gas.

Pressure = Constant * Density * Temperature

- Gas cools down, atoms move more slowly, pressure decreases.
- Gas heats up, atomsmove more rapidly, pressure increases.

Density and Temperature Throughout the Sun
------------------------------------------

The high pressure in the core (required by hydrostatic equilibrium) means that temperature and density must be higher in the centre area as opposed to the surface layers.

Energy Transport in the Sun
---------------------------

Energy is generated in the hot core and transported to the cool photosphere (only visible layer), where it is lost in to space.

### Radiative Zone

- Consists of 70% of the Sun itself.
- Energy is transported by photons.
- Each photon only travels a short distance before being absorbed and re-emitted (note, random walk).


### Convective Zone

- Consists of 30% of the Sun itself.
- Energy transported by circulations of risign hot gas and falling cool gas.
- Can be seen at phtoosphere as *granulation* pattern.

The Chromosphere
----------------

Lower part of the Sun's atmosphere, which is 2,000 kilometres in thickness. Visible during total eclipse as thin red zone around the edge (hydrogen Balmer emission!).

- Temperature increases with height (4,500 K to 50,000 K).
- Contains spicules - thin column of hot gas.

The Corona
----------

Upper part of the Sun's atmosphere. Extends from top of chromosphere out to a few times the Sun's radius.

- Visible during total eclipses as extended region of thin gas.
- Low density but very hot - temperatures up to millions of K.
- Strongly affected by Sun's magnetic fields (which explains the low pressure with high temperature - temperature inversion).

### The Sun's Magnetic Fields

Sun's interior is a circulating electrically conducting fluid (because the Sun rotates, and the gas is ionized). The interior works as a *dynamo* - generating a magnetic field. This field traps hot gas in the Corona, creating beautiful glowing loops.

### Why is the Corona so hot?

Turbulent motions in photosphere cause magnetic waves to travel outward. As the density in the atmosphere gets smaller, the waves become larger (whip analogy).

Then, the magnetic waves shakes the gas **back and forth, heating it up**.

The Solar Wind
--------------

In *coronal holes* (weaker spots in the Corona), the magnetic field is weak. The pressure of the gas in these holes caues it to flow outward into the space.

This overall outflow is known as the *solar wind*. The solar wind extends out until it collides with *interstellar gas*.

Solar Seismology: Probing the Sun's Interior
--------------------------------------------

Gasmotions in the convection zone generates waves, the waves cause the photosphere to rise and fall...

What Keeps the Sun Shining?
---------------------------

For the Sun to keep shining, the energy leaving the Sun must be replaced by some reserve. Possible energy reserves are...

- Chemical (coal...?).
- Gravitational (as the Sun shrinks, energy is released).
- Nuclear.

Time scale argument: only the release of nuclear energy can keep the Sun shining for billions of years. So the Sun only kept shining for the existence of nuclear reaction in its core.

### The First Step: Creating Deuterium

Protons repel each other due to *electromagnetic force*. However, at high temperature the protons get close enough for *strong force* to overwhelm repulsion.

*Weak force* then comes into play, converting protons to neutron plus *neutrino* plus *positron*.

### What happens to the Neutrino and Positron?

The positron (the anti-matter version of an electron) combines with an electron and *annihilates* it, producing two gamma rays (photons).

Detecting Solar Neutrinos
-------------------------

Difficult to detect: almost all pass straight though Earth without stopping... Special detectors look for flashes of light when a single neutrino interacts with liquid.

Only 1/3 of predicted solar neutrinos are detected (the *"solar neutrino problem"*):

- Issue with our understanding of Sun's core (solar seismology says no)?
- Possiblity that neutrinos transforms into other "flavors" (electron-neutrinos, etc.)?
