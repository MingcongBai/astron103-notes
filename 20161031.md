A Photon's Journey
------------------

Nuclear reactions create a gamma ray in the star's core - how long before the energy reaches the surface?

- Direct path: 2 seconds.
- But photon can't travel more than few centimetres before bein absorbed and re-emitted (sometimes as multiple photons).
- Indirect path: millions of years;

When it finally reaches the surface, energy is distributed across millions of photons.

Formation of Stellar Spectra
----------------------------

Apply Kirchhoff's Laws:

- Photons from hot,d ense interior show *contnuous spectrum* (in fact, a *black body spectrum*).
- As these photons pass through the cool, low density *photosphere*, they are **selectively absorbed** at certain wavelengths, leading to an *absorption spectrum*.

### The Strength of Spectral Lines

When we look at an absorption spectrum, some lines are strong (very dark), and some are weak (not so dark). Why?

- Abundances: more abundant elements have more atoms available to absorb photons.
- Atomic Physics: some electron transitions are more probable than others.
- Temperature: the number of atoms in the appropriate initial state depends on temperature.

### Estimating Surface Temperature with Wien's Law

Peak emission of a star's spectrum reflects its temperature (maximum brightness at a certain color).

### The Road to Spectral Classification

In late 19th century, **Henry Draper** begins recording photographic spectra, his window endowed project to compile spectra for all bright stars in the sky.

Spectra was assigned alphabetic types A-Q, based mostly strength of hydrogen lines, A being the strongest, O very weak (in terms of hydrogen lines).

### Annie Jump Cannon

Created the Havard System of Spectral Classification, one of the most important astronomers in the modern era. Performed most of the classification work for the Henry-Draper catalog (1/4 million stars).

Rearranged and simplified the classification sequence based on their temperatures (calculated with Wien's Law).

    O - B - A - F - K - M

From the hottest to coolest.

Later in the 1990s, astronomers found extra classes L and T, which are cool bodies in the space (very cool stars). Also, finer gradations were added so...

### Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin

First woman full professor at Harvard University. Demostrated that the strength of a spectral line depends on temperature.

Discovered that virtually all stars are composed **mostly of hydrogen**.

Binary Stars
------------

Two stars orbiting around each other. Many stars (if no tmost) turn out closer inspection to be binary stars.

Interaction between the two stars can have significant results. Can be used to measure stellar masses (via Newton's version of Kepler's Third Law).

### Types of Double Star

- Apparent double star (not a true binary);
- Visual binary:
  - We can see both stars;
  - Over time, the star's position change as they orbit each other;
- Spectroscopic binary:
  - Stars are too close together to tell apart;
  - But their combined spectrum shows absorption lines from each;
  - Over time, the lines move back and forth due to changing Doppler Shifts;
- Eclipsing binary;
