Why is it cold in winter in Wisconsin?
--------------------------------------

- A. Because the Earth is farthest from the Sun.
- B. Because the Earth is closest to the Sun.
- C. Because the Sun doesn't rise.
- D. Because the Northern hemisphere is tilted away from the sun.
- E. Because the Northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun.

The answer is D. (When it is winter in Wisconsin, the Earth is actually the closest to the Sun).

The tilt of the Earth's rotation axis
-------------------------------------

The rotation axis of the Earth is tilted by 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun.

- Reason to change of seasons.
- Reason to change in length of days.

At the beginning of summer and winter, the Earth's rotation axis (North Pole Axis specifically) is tilted toward and away from the Sun, respectively. At the beginning of spring and fall, there is virtually no tilt toward or away from the Sun.

The Sun's beam changes in width when arriving at the earth:

- At somewhere in summer season, the Sun's beam falls fully on a given area;
- At somewhere in the winter season, only parts of the Sun's beam falls on a given area (more spread out, both in heat transport and radiation);

The angle between the overhead and the Sun position changes from Summer to Winter - as it gets larger, the less effective the Sun's power becomes.

The Ecliptic vs the Celestial Equator
-------------------------------------

The Ecliptic has varying angle from the Celestial Equator:

- At the beginning of summer, the Sun's ecliptic is 23.5 degrees due north to the Celestial Equator;
- At the beginning of winter, the Sun's ecliptic is 23.5 degrees due south to the Celestial Equator;
- At the beginning of spring and fall, the Sun's ecliptic overlaps with the Celestial Equator;

Also, the rising and setting point of the Sun varies by seasons:

- At the beginning of spring and fall, the Sun rises due East and sets due West (at *Equinox*);
- At the beginning of summer (and for the whole summer), the Sun rises due North-East, and sets due North-West;
- At the beginning of winter (and for the whole winter), the Sun rises due South-East, and sets due South-West;

The Sun's Ecliptic will move further to the South and North in winter and summer respectively, until it reaches Winter and Summer Solstice, then the ecliptic will move toward the West-East line.

The Sun's motion from the Pole and Equator
------------------------------------------

If one stands on the North Pole on Equinoxes, the Sun's Ecliptic is parallel to the horizon (23.5 degrees above the horizon), the North Pole gets 24 hours of sunlight.

If one stands on the Equator on Equinoxes, the Sun's Ecliptic is parallel to the Equator, rises and sets exactly at the East and West, respectively. And it reaches the Zenith at the middle of the day.

The Solar Day
-------------

*Apparent Noon* on each day is when the Sun is at its highest point in the sky. *The Solar Day* is the time between two successive apparent noons.

- At Apparent Noon, the Sun crosses the *Meridian* (the line deviding the East and West halves of the sky).
- The day is divided into A.M. and P.M:
  - A.M.: Ante-Meridian;
  - P.M.: Post-Meridian;

The Sidereal Day
----------------

*The Sidereal Day* is the time taken between two successive meridian crossings of a star.

- It is slightly **shorter** than a solar day: 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.0905 seconds.
- Astronomers use clocks which measure *sidereal time* (ST), because a given star crosses the meridian at the  exactly same point in time - throughout the year.

Time Zones
----------

The Earth is divided into 24 time zones, in order to provide each areas with a virtually synchronized time in regard to the Sun's position in the sky.

The time zone lines does not always show as a vertical line, to accomondate for some nations and regions.

#### Daylight Saving Time

Read [DST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time).

Leap Seconds
------------

The second was originally defined so that there are 86,400 seconds in one day (24x60x60 seconds). However the Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down (by 0.7 seconds per year) due to [tidal braking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration).

- This means that apparent noon occurs a little later from one year to the next.
- To keep atomic clocks in agreement with the Sun and stars, they are calibrated every few years to put them in sync.
