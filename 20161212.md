Type Ia Supernovae as Standard Candles
--------------------------------------

Type Ia supernovae arise when an accreting white dwarf is pushed over the Chandrasekhar mass limit, therefore they are all essentially identical events (explosion),

Once we know their intrinsic luminosity, we can use them as standard candles to measure distances to far-away galaxies.

Note: Not even the Omega_M = 0 case (no matter), a universe still fits the supernova measurements.

Dark Energy
-----------

We can fit the supernova measurements very well by assuming a non-zero Cosmological Constant. This behaves liek a repulsive force filling space, which does not change as the universe expands.

This repulsive force is named "dark energy":

- Like dark matter, it cannot be detected via Electro-magnetic radiation.
- Like dark matter, it affects the expansion of Universe.

CMB Fluctuations
----------------

Tiny fluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background tells us...

- That the universe is very close to flat.
- The relative proportion of ordinary matter, dark matter, and dark energy.

The Distant Future
------------------

- In 10e+9 years: Milky Way merges with Andromeda Galaxy.
- In 10e+12 years: All other galaxies in local group merge to form a single giant galaxy.
- In 10e+14 years: Last stars in the galaxy fades away.
- In 10e+20 years: Orbits in binary/planetary systems shrink (due to gravitational radiation) and coalesce.
- In 10e+40 years: Protons may decay.
- In 10e+60 to 10e+100 years: Black holes evaporate into radiation.
