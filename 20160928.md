Issac Newton
------------

Pioneered modern studies of motion, optics, and gravity.

- Invented calculus.
- Realized that the planets are held in orbit around the Sun, by the same force which causes things to fall into the ground on Earth (universality of gravity).

Inertia and Mass
----------------

**Inertia** is the tendency for an object to continue at a fixed speed, if there are no other forces acting on it. One may think of it as a "reluctance" to change speed.

- The inertia of an object is measured by its mass *(the amount of substance making up the object)*.
- **Mass is not the same as weight.**

Newton's First Law
------------------

*"A body maintains a constant velocity unless forces act on it."*

Velocity is a combination of **speed and direction**, force is a push or a pull (or is it).

Understanding forces
--------------------

Most generally: a force is something which can cause an object to change velocity.

- Similar to velocity, force has magnitude and direction.
- Doesn't require contact (gravity, magnetism).
- Measured in *Newtons* (N).

Net force on an object is found by adding up all the individual forces.

Weight
------

Weight is the force of gravity. Weight is a special name we have given to this phenomenon.

- Weight depends on an object's environment, while mass **does not**.
  - On Earth, a 100kg person weighs 980 N.
  - On Moon, a 100kg person weighs 100 N.
  - In orbit arond the Earth, a 100kg person weighs 0 N.

Quantifying changes in velocity
-------------------------------

Acceleration is the change in velocity over the change in time of an object.

- Measured in meters per second per second (second^2).
- Like velocity, acceleration has magnitude and direction.

Representing velocity changes with vectors
------------------------------------------

Use arrows to represent the initial and final velocity vectors, the change in velocity is the vector which must be added to the initial velocity to get final velocity.

Newton's Second Law
-------------------

*"The force (F) acting on an object equals the product of its acceleration (a) and its mass (m)."*

`F = m x a`

Newton's Third Law
------------------

*"When two bodies interact, they create equal and opposite forces on each other."*

The Earth-Moon System
---------------------

- Equal and opposite gravitational forces attract the Earth and the Moon.
- Because the Earth is much more massive than the Moon, its acceleration is much smaller. Thereforce, the Earth only moves a little compared to the Moon.

Rockets in the Space
--------------------

The rocket engine accelerates gases to high speeds, this acceleration is produced by the engine exerting a backward force on the gases.

- By Newton's Third Law, there must be an equal and opposite (forward) force on the rocket.
- There is no need for the rocket to "push" against a surrounding atmosphere, this thrust will still work as expected in space.
