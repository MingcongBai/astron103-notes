Using Radar To Measure Distances
--------------------------------

Radar transmits signal at speed of light, `c`. As signals hit a target (say, the Moon) from the Earth, reflecting a signal back - at the speed of light.

In relation with time needed, `t`, we can come up with this simple equation:

`2d = ct`

Using Triangulation To Measure Distances
----------------------------------------

`d = b * tan(a)`

Where:

- `d` is the distance to be found.
- `b` is the baseline of the "triangle".
- `a` is the angle.

Halley Measures the Distance to Venus
-------------------------------------

- Measure duration of Venus's *transit* across the Sun's surface.
- Duration depends on where on the Earth you observe the transit.
- Measuring difference in duration let Halley calculate difference in Venus's angular position.
- Used *triangulation* to measure the distance.

Astronomical Parallax
---------------------

Observe the same nearby star 6 months apart, as it appears to move against the backdrop of other stars.

### The Parallax Formula

Because the stars are so far away, their parallax `p` is tiny.

- Usually measured in arcseconds (1 arcsecond = 1/3600 degree).
- Only measurable using modern instruments (first stellar parallax measured by Friedrich bessel in 1838).

### Parallax Formula in Action

Parallaxes become progressively smaller for stars at greater distances, until recently, parallax could reliably be used to measure distances out to only 500 parsecs.

Own own Galaxy is 30,000 parsecs across.

The GAIA Mission
----------------

European Space Agency aircraft, launched in 2013. 5-year mission will measure positions and velocities of 1 billion stars.

Parallaxes accurate to 25 microarcseconds.

- Distance at 1 kpc accurate to 2.5%.
- Distance at 10 kpc accurate to 25% (note the linearity).

Proper Motion
-------------

In addition to yearly parallax motion, stars show *proper motion* due to their movement in space transverse (across) the line of sight. This proper motion is usually measured in arcseconds per year.

By combining the distance `d` and the proper motion `u`, we can calculate a star's transverse velocity:

`V_t = (4.74 km/s) * (u arcsec/yr) * (d pc)`

The Luminosity of Stars
-----------------------

The *Luminosity* of a star (or other object) measures how much energy it emits into space every second (J/s). Luminosity is measured in watts (1 W = 1 J/s).

Becasue stellar luminosities are so large, we often measure its luminosity relative to the Sun's luminosity (Solar Luminosity).

The luminosity star is an *intrinsic property*, which does not depend on its distance to the observer.

The Relationship between Luminosity and Brightness
--------------------------------------------------

The *inverse square law* tells us the apparent brightness `B` of an object varies inversely with the square of the distance `d` to the object.

```
B = (L) / (4 * pi * d^2)
```

Conversely, if we measure the brightness of an object, we can determine its luminosity using the formula:

```
L = 4 * pi * d^2 * B
```

Standard Candles
----------------

For some special types of star, their luminosity is known.

We can use these stars as *standard candles* - allowing us to calculate their distances fromtheir known luminosity and measured brightness:

```
d = (L / (4 * pi * B))^(1 / 2)
```

Distance to nearby galaxies is far beyond the reach of parallax, but can be determined using a variable stars known as *Cepheids*.

The Magnitude System
--------------------

Hipparcus introduced a system of labeling stars by their brightness.

- 1 corresponds to the brightest.
- 6 corresponds to the dimmest.

Astronomers still use magnitude as a way of quantifying the apparent brightness (`B`) of a star. A difference of 2.5 magnitudes corresponds a brightness ratio of 100:0. Brighter stars have more negative magnitudes; **some stars have negative magnitudes!**

### Magnitude Math

The magnitude system uses the mathematical idea of *logarithms*. The **difference** in the magnitudes of two stars depends on the **logarithm** of the **ratio** of their brightnesses:

```
m_1 - m_2 = -2.5 log(B_1 / B_2)
```

The *absolute magnitude* `M` of a star is its magnitude if it were placed at a distance of 10 parsec. It gives us a magnitue-based measurement of the star's luminosity.
