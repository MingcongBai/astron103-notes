Ancient Life on Earth
---------------------

Microfossils of cells were found in rocks, of at least 3 billion years old. Also cultures of these early life forms were discovered: *Stromatolites* - sediment deposits laid down by *cyanobacteria* (blue-green algae).

Common Chemistry of Life
------------------------

- Basic building blocks are *amino acids*...
- Long chains of amino acids form *proteins*...
- Heritable genetic code stored in *DNA* (DeoxyriboNucleicAcid)...
- Commonalities suggest all life on Earth has a common origin.

The Origin of Life
------------------

Current hypothesis is that life began from chemical reactions among complex molecules... The *Miller-Urey Experiment* shows that amino acids could form from lightning strikes in a primeval atmosphere.

Initially, genetic code could have been carried by simpler molecules (say, *RNA*).

Life Elsewhere in the Solar System
----------------------------------

Some of the icy moon of Jupiter (Europa for one) and Saturn (Enceladus) appear to have a subsurface liquid ocean.

Titan (Saturn's largest moon) has a thick atmosphere and liquid hydrocarbon seas.

The Habitable Zone
------------------

The range of distances from a star where water can remain in liquid form:

- For really cool stars, the habitable zone is so close in that planets are tidally locked (no self-rotation).
- For really hot stars, the habitable zone is bathed in UV radiation.

### Galatic Habitable Zone

There is also a habitable zone on the scale of a galaxy, as the near-core has too many stellar objects that interferes with the development of life; and likewise, if one gets too far away, there will be little element available for formation of stars and systems.
