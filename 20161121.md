What is a Pulsar?
-----------------

- A. A type of White Dwarf
- B. A type of Red Giant
- C. A type of Neutron Star
- D. A type of Supernova
- E. A type of star cluster

A pulsar is a type of Neutron Star. [Wikipedia: Pulsar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar)

Changes in Pulsar Rotation
--------------------------

Pulsars slows down over time, from a rotation per a fraction of second, to a rotation per ten seconds - and even more, as slow as it could still support the energy to generate pulse signals.

Internal Structure of Neutron Stars
-----------------------------------

A Neutron Star has a radius of ~10 kilometres, with a rigid crust (iron?) of approximately a few hundred metres thick.

Inside, is believed to be *neutron superfluid*.

Magnetars
---------

Magnetic fields up to 10^15 gauss (Earth's field has the strength of 1 gauss).

Field becomes stretched as crust rearranges, and then snaps like a rubber band. Energy released by the Magnetars are seen in X-Rays and Gamma Rays (too hot).

SGR 1806-20 (magnetar outburst in 2004) is the most energetic event ever recorded.

Revisiting Escape Velocity
--------------------------

Velocity of an object needs to escape from the gravitational pull of a body with mass *M* at a distance *R*.

```
V = sqrt[ (2GM) / R ]
```

### Thought Experiment: Escape velocity for objects compressed to the size of Madison

- Earth of the size of Madison: 280 km/s
- Sun of the size of Madison: 160,000 km/s
- 2-Solar Masses Star of the size of Madison: 230,000 km/s
- 3-Solar Masses Star of the size of Madison: 330,000 km/s

Where...

- 4-Solar Masses Star of the size of Madison: exceeds *c*!

Introducing Black Holes
-----------------------

A region of space enclosing so much mass that the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light - the size of a black holes is given by its *Schwarzschild Radius*:

```
R_s = (2GM) / (c^2)
```

The location `R = R_s` is known as the *event horizon*.

Anything passing through the event horizon can never escape; instead, it collapses down to a single point at the center, known as a *singularity*.

### If the Sun was transformed into a Black Hole...

Nothing would happen to Earth! The Earth will stay in its old orbit, as the new Black Hole still has the same mass, therefore the same escape valocity...

... Well except Earth will stay in eternal darkness.

### Any how...

A Black Hole stays like any normal astronmical object when outside of the event horizon.

Time Dilation Near a Black Hole
-------------------------------

As we approach the event horizon, times slows down to a halt.

One would never see another dropping into the event horizon, but not for the one dropping into the event horizon - time went on as usual.

The Milky Way: A Glowing Band on the Night Sky
----------------------------------------------

The Milky Way is made of stars, the stars making up the Milky Way form a huge structure known as a *galaxy*.

### The Shape of the Milky Way

If the Milky Way were spherical, stars would lie in more or less every direction. However, as what we observed as a "band" on the sky, the Milky Way is a disk.

### Early Mapping of the Milky Way

Caroline and William Herschel (sister/brother) measured the number of stars in each direction of the sky.

- Assuming we can see right to the edge of Milky Way, this tell us how far away the edge is.
- They found a disk with the Sun near the center, about 2 kiloparsecs (kpc) in diameter.

In fact, we don't see all the way to the edge.

### Kapteyn's Universe

Jacobus Kapteyn used modern instruments and photography to determine the size of the Milky Way.

- Distance measured were based on *proper motions*.
- Much larger than Herschel measurements, but Sun was observed to be near the center.
- The diameter of the Milky Way was found to be 18 kpc.

### Harlow Shapley's Milky Way

Using Globular Clusters, Harlow Shapley determine that Sun is about 15 kpc from the center of the Milky Way.

Still, Shapley did not take dust and clouds into account.

### Features of the Milky Way

The Milky Way is believed to be a Spiral Galaxy:

- The Sun is ~8 kpc from the center.
- Bulge at the center.
- ...
