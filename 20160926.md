Planets: Star-Like Wanderers
----------------------------

- Sun, Moon, and Stars move from East to West in the sky.
  - Rising, setting of the Sun during the day.
  - Rising, setting of Moon and stars during the night.
- But the positions of the Sun, Moon, and a few wandering stars (planets)change from one day to the next against the backdrop of stars on the celestial sphere.
- This motion relative to the stars is West to East?
- Like the Moon, the planets move close to (but not exactly) the ecliptic.

Retrograding Motion
-------------------

The "back-and-forth" motion of planets due to to the relative location of the orbit of the Earth (usually West to East, but East to West when reversing).

*Retrograde*: Moving East to West (rather than usual West to East).

### The Case of Mars

Mars seems brighter during retrograde movements.

Euxodos's Geocentric Model of the Universe
------------------------------------------

Where the Earth is at the center of the Universe, in which stars and planets moves on one of the multiple crystal-like spheres by its rotation.

Ptolemy Explains Retrograde Motion
----------------------------------

- Planets move around a circle called a *epicycle*, or a smaller "circle" of orbits.
- The center of the epicycle moves around another circle called *deferent* (the overall orbit of the epicycles).
- To match detailed observations, *equants* were introduced.

Occam's Razor
-------------

William of Ocaam (1287 - 1347 C.E.) was a Franciscan friar and philosopher who was born and lived in England. He believed in the idea of:

*"Entities must not be multiplied unnecessarily"*

This idea of *"Occam's Razor"* has become one of the corner stones of scientific reasoning.

Nicolaus Copernicus
-------------------

Nicolaus Copernicus "shaves" with Occam's Razor. Further modifications to Ptolemy's system (e.g., equants) destroy the simplicity of the model.

The Polish astronomer believed Sun is at the center of the Universe:

- The Earth takes 1 year to complete an orbit around the Sun; Mars takes 1.88 years.
- Every 780 days, the Earth catches up with Mars, and "laps" it.
- As Earth passes Mars, the movement of Mars against the sky appears to be reversed.
- During this event, the Mars is the closest to the Earth, therefore **the brightest**.

When does to planet show retrograde motion?
-------------------------------------------

First, some terminologies:

- **Opposition:** planet on opposite side of the Earth from the Sun.
- **Conjunction:** planet on the same side of the Earth from the Sun.

Retrograde motions arises during opposition (outer planet), or inferior conjunction (of the inner plannet).

What else does the Heliocentric Model give us?
----------------------------------------------

- The greatest elongation of Venus is 47 degrees, and Mercury has the greatest elongation of 28 degrees.
  - This can be explained by the heliocentric model, if Venus and Mercury closer to the Sun than the Eart.
  - Usign simple trigonometries, we can calculate the orbit sizes from the greatest elongation.

Planets | Copernicus Calculation | Modern Calculation
--------|------------------------|-------------------
Mercury | 0.38 AU                | 0.39 AU
Venus   | 0.72 AU                | 0.72 AU
Earth   | 1.00 AU                | 1.00 AU
Mars    | 1.52 AU                | 1.52 AU
Jupiter | 5.22 AU                | 5.20 AU
Saturn  | 9.17 AU                | 9.54 AU

Tycho Brahe Measures the Stars
------------------------------

Danish nobelman who built and used an advanced naked eye observatory on the island of Hven. Observed a nova (new star) in 1572 and showed it must lie as distant as the stars.

Fun facts:

- Owned a pet moose, which died after a drunken tumble down a staircase.
- Lost his nose during a duel, wore a fake nose.
- Died of a burst bladder.

Johannes Kepler
---------------

The heliocentric model with circular orbits doesn't match... the motion of stars and planets in the sky.

The first to discover the elliptic shape of orbits.

### Kepler's First Law

*"Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse."*

- There is nothing at the other focus!
- At perihelion, the planet is the closest to the Sun:

`d = (1 - e) * a`

- At aphelion, the planet is farthest from the Sun:

`d = (1 + e) * a`

### Kepler's Second Law

*"The orbital speed of a planet varies so that a line joining the Sun and the planet will sweep over equal areas in equal time intervals."*

Planets move faster at perihelion, and slowest at aphelion.

### Kepler's Third Law

*"The amount of time a planet takes to orbit the Sun, P, is related to its orbit's size, a."*

`P^2 = a^3`

- Measure `P` in years, and `a` in AU.
- Bigger orbits means longer periods, and vice versa.

Galileo Galilei Argues the Case
-------------------------------

Pioneered the use of mathematics as the language in science. Observed the sky with one of the first telescopes.

Presented convincing evidence for the heliocentric model:

- Mountains on the Moon.
- Moons orbiting around Jupiter.
- Spots on the Sun.
- Phases of Venus.
