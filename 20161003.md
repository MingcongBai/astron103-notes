What makes the Moon orbit the Earth?
------------------------------------

*"A body maintains a constant velocity unless forces act on it."*

### Newton's Cannonball: A Thought Experiment

- If we shoot the cannonball faster, it will go further before it falls to the ground.
- If we shoot it sufficiently fast, it will keep falling but never reach the ground.
- The cannonball has then entered *orbit* around the Earth.

### The Importance of Newton's Cannonball

The force that causes objects to fall to Earth, is the same force responsible for orbits: **gravity**.

Figuring Out Gravity
--------------------

The force due to gravity...

1. ...must depend on the mass of the object doing the pulling **(why?)**.
2. ...must also depend on the mass of the object being pulled **(why?)**.
3. ...must grow weaker as the two objects become more distant **(why?)**.

### Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation

*"Every mass exerts a force of attraction on every other mass. The strength of the force is directly proportional to the product of these masses divided by the square of the distance between them."*

`F_G = G * [ (M * m) / d ^ 2 ]`

- The force is *directly proportional* to the mass of each body.
  - Double the mass, the the force is increased by a factor of 2.

### Measuring G

Henry Cavendish measured the gravitational constant in 1797.

Weightlessness
--------------

In orbit around the Earth, it seems like things have no weight (no gravity). In fact, ravity is still present, and nearly as strong as on the Earth's surface.

- What is happening is that the spaceship, and everything on it, is being accelerated by gravity at exactly the same rate ("falling together").

Centripital Force: The Force Required to Produce Circular Motion
----------------------------------------------------------------

*"To produce circular motion, a force is required."* (Newton's First Law)

*"If V is the velocity of the motion, d is the radius of the object, and m its mass, then Newton Showed that the required centripetal force is shown below."*
