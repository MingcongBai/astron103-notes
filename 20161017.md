Whose Law Related the Wavelength of Peak Brightness to the Temperature, for a Black Body?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A. Newton's
- B. Kepler's
- C. Wien's
- D. Stefan's
- E. Boltzmann's

The answer is C, **Wien's Law**. Recall from last lecture... Wien's Law describes that:

*"The hotter a body is the more strongly it will radiate at short wavelengths."* Note that the amount of emission at **ALL** wavelengths also increases! **Wien's Law only applies to thermal radiation!**

The Spectrograph
----------------

Instrument for measuring the spectrum of a light source. Spectrum is usually projected onto a camera, so that it can be recorded and studied later.

Gratings and Prisms both spreads light into a spectrum (due to difference in deflection with different wavelengths for different light colors) - gratings are usually used over prisms.

Hydrogen Energy Levels
----------------------

**Recall:** When an electron moves from one orbital to another, the atom's energy changes by the difference between the orbital's energies. Orbitals are usually referred as energy levels.

The energy levels of hydrogen is given by the *Bohr's Formula*, or  the [*Bohr Model*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model).

Energy change in a hydrogen atom results in absorption or emission of **photons**, showing a light spectrum (glowing). Notice nebulae in the cosmos shows red, showing an abundance of hydrogen atom.

Note that the emission graph of a hydrogen atom shows that the **larger** the difference in energy level (changes), the **less** brightness of a light of specific color (representing the difference in energy level, emission) we could see. **This property is specific to hydrogen atoms**.

### See also, the Emission-Line Spectrum of Helium Atoms

As seen [here](http://www.astronomynotes.com/light/hehybig.gif).

Historical fact: Helium is first found from the Sun, not on Earth (found 30 years later) - first dicovered during a Solar Eclipse.

Absorption-Line Spectrum
------------------------

To create such a spectrum...

- Create a continuous spectrum from a hot, dense spectrum (Blackbody-like).
- Place a **cool** cloud of hydrogen gas in from of the source.
- At wavelengths corresponding to Balmer Series, the light is **missing**.
- The missing light has been used to lift electrons from `n = 2` to `n = 3,4,5, ...` (absorption lines).

Note: a cool medium, in regard to the hot light source is the key to such a spectrum.

Kirchhoff's Laws
----------------

Defines a collection of spectrum, and the conditions needed for producing specific kinds of spectrums.

### Continuous Spectrum

Produced by hot solid or dense gas. No distinct features, or sharp "edges" in the spectrum.

### Emission-Line Spectrum

Produced by hot low-density gas. Only showing wavelengths emitted by atoms.

### Absorption-Line Spectrum

Produced continuous spectrum (hot solid or dense gas), passing through a cool medium. Showing a full continuous spectrum with those in emission-line spectrum removed.

The Spectrum of the Sun
-----------------------

We know...

- The Sun's interior is a hot, dense gas.
- The Sun's surface layer are a cool, low-density gas.

### What sort of spectrum will the Sun show?

- A. Continuous
- B. Emission-Line Spectrum
- C. Absorption-Line Spectrum

According to *Kirchhoff's Laws*, it will show an Absorption-Line Spectrum - hot source through a cooler medium.

The Sun's spectrum shows many absorption lines, while the strength of each line depends on:

- Number of atoms (abundance) of elements (in source of light emission) producing the line.
- Transition probability (change in energy level).
- Temperature of the medium.

Which explains why that given 71.1% of the elements in the Sun is hydrogen, but the calcium atoms are showing a stronger absorption-line, with 27.4% in proportion.

Ionization
----------

The **ionization energy** is the energy requried to lift an electron from its *ground state* to an infinite distance from the nucleus (essentially "stripping" the electron from an atom).

Any energy level higher than the given **ionization energy** will be able to "strip" electrons from an atom - ionizing (a given wavelength, or shorter - implicating a higher energy).

The Doppler Effect
------------------

The change in wavelength depending on the direction of the travelling waves.

- Waves emitted by a source approaching us have a **higher** frequency - shorter wavelengths.
- Waves emitted by a source receding away have a **lower** frequency - longer wavelength.

*"Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-oooooo-m..."* As a car sounds its horn at you (suppose you weren't crashed into, of course, no one gets hurt).

Which also applies to the wavelengths of lights.

### The Doppler Shift Formula

The Doppler Effect depends only on **radial motion** (toward/away from us); it does **not** arise from **transverse motion** (say, standing perpendicular at the direction of the movement). The *Doppler Shift* allows us to calculate the radial velocity `V_R` of a light source...

- `V_R > 0` means recession (motion away from us, a *redshift*);
- `V_R < 0` means approach (motion towards us; a *blueshift*);

### Rotational Broadening (The Case of a Rotating Star)

Better shown [here](http://www.ngawhetu.com/Resources/StellarVelocity/images/rotationalbroadening.jpg).

### Thermal Boardening

Better shown [here](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cms/cpg15x/albums/userpics/thermalbroadening.jpg).

Also, recall the foundation of thermal changes - which is essentially the internal movement of atoms inside of an object.


### Doppler Imaging

The case of asteroid Toutatis... with a doppler image, shown [here](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/image/planetary/asteroid/toutatis.jpg).

Launch radio waves at an asteroid, "listen" for the reflection:

- Time delay of reflected signal tells us the **distance**.
- Wavelength of reflected signal tells us the **velocity**.

Given all information provided, an image of an astronomical object may be formed using radio waves alone.
