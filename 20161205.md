Which of these is NOT in the Local Group?
-----------------------------------------

- A. The Magellanic Clouds
- B. The Andromeda Galaxy (M31)
- C. The Triangulum Galaxy (M33)
- D. The Whirlpool Galaxy
- E. The Canis Minor Dwarf Galaxy

The Whirlpool Galaxy is not within the Local Group! The Whirlpool is in the M51 Group.

What is Dark Matter?
--------------------

Most matter in the Universe is not ordinary matter but *dark matter*. We infer the existence of this dark matter from its gravitational pull - not from visual (or direct) ways.

- It's name indicates that it doesn't emit light.

### Measuring Galatic Mass from Galatic Rotation

In the last lecture we discussed the galatic rotation and its relationship with galatic mass - using the equation below.

-------------------------

We could measure galatic mass with from galatic *rotation*.

```
M(_<R) = (V^2 * R) / G
```

Where:

- `M` is the mass notation.
  - `_<R` specifies the mass to be "mass within a certain radius"
- `V` is the velocity for a certain astronomical object (say, the Sun; however usually calculated to be 220 km/s).
- `R` is the distance (radius) from the center of the galaxy.
- `G` is the standard G.

-------------------------

And in the case of a Flat Galatic Rotation, this is a strong suggestion to the existence of dark matter. Similar phenomenom was also discovered in other *spiral galaxies*. Incorporating gas, stars, and dark matter, a rotation curve shows what we discovered.

But still, dark matter is still holds a hypothesized existence.

*Conclusion: Dark matter "halo" contains ~10 times the mass of ordinary matter.*

Dark Matters in Clusters
------------------------

The mass of a cluster can be estimated from the relative velocities of galaxies in the cluster. By using this approach, we find masses ~100 times larger than predicted by combined starlight.

The intra-cluster medium explains some of the missing mass, but we still must invoke dark matter, with a mass of ~10 times the ordinary matter - agreeing with the case of the Milky Way Galaxy.

Dark matters varies amoothly throughout cluster, with concentrations around the individual galaxies.

Another Way to Detect Mass
--------------------------

Recall, Quasars are "stars" - that are actually bright cores of galaxies (Seyfert). Sometimes we were able to see "two" quasars, due to *Gravitational Lensing*. By measuring the lensing, we could determine the cluster mass. Providing an independent confirmation of large amounts of dark matter.

See [Einstein Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Cross).

The Nature of Dark Matter
-------------------------

See [Bullet Cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_Cluster).

The case of Bullet Cluster shows that dark matter went "through" in a collision. Dark matter *does not* fill up space like gas, but in another way that we had not yet been able to identify.

### The MACHO Hypothesis

Or MAssive Compact Halo Objet - planets, old white dwarfs, and neutron stars, black holes.

Searches for MACHOs are based on gravitational lensing of stars in nearby galaxies (say, Magellanic Clouds). Passage of a MACHO in front of background star causes a brief brightening. Evidence so far indicates that MACHOs can only account for a small fraction of dark matter "halo".

### The WIMP Hypothesis

Or Weakly Interacting Massive Particles.

Massive cousins to neutrinos - and similarly, they don't interact with ordinary matters often. Some experiments (e.g. aboard the International Space Station) hint at WIMPs.

Leading hyptohesis among others, but evidence is still inconclusive.

Cosmology
---------

Big questions in our course:

- Is the Universe infinite, or does it have an edge?
- Has it always existed, or did it begin at a point in the pass?

And...

- The afterglow from the Big Bang can be detected today.
- By studying this afterglow, we can learn more about the beginning of the Universe.

### Hubble's Law: Are we at the center?

No, this is an expansion with no center.

#### The Cosmological Principle

A universe obeying Hubble's Law has no preferred center of expansion:

*The Cosmological Principle: There are no special position in the Universe.*

It does not make sense to think of the universe's expansion as resulting from an explosion at some point - instead, *general relativity* tells us that the expansion of the Universe acts more like a rubberband.

### Redshift in an Expanding Universe

The Hubble's Law Redshift of Galaxies is not due to their motion, but due to the *expansion of space*. As space expands, the distance between successive crests of electromagnetic waves increases - effectively lengthening the waves.
